# atomized_image

A widget which paints and animates images with particles to achieve an atomized effect.

Credits to Jason Labbe, for the original [sketch][sketch] from where most of the code of this package is.

![Overview][overview]

## Install

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  atomized_image: <latest_version>
```

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:atomized_image/atomized_image.dart';
```

## Getting started

Example:

```dart
AtomizedImage(
  // Use an ImageProvider to get the image you want to atomize.
  image: NetworkImage('https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/653618067084218368/XlQA-oRl_400x400.jpg'),
)
```

To change the image and animates the particles again, just change the image provider with a new one.
